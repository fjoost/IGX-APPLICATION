Write a function in PHP that computes the first 10 pivot numbers. Pivot numbers are those natural numbers where their predecessors add up to the same as N contiguous successor numbers.
For example the number 6 would be the pivot of the sequence: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8, since 1+2+3+4+5 is equal to 7 + 8, being 6 in the middle of both sequences.
